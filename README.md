# Installation
### 1. **Prerequisites**:
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. If not, download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Web Server**: For local development, you might need a local server like `http-server`. You can install it globally with npm:
  ```bash
  npm install -g http-server
  ```

### 2. **Clone the Repository**:
If the game's code is hosted on a Git repository (e.g., GitHub), clone it:
```bash
git clone [[repository-url]](https://github.com/alfahadgm/Pixel-Runner-Roguelite.git)
cd Pixel-Runner-Roguelite
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**:
If the game uses third-party packages or dependencies, install them:
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. **Running the Game**:
- If the game uses a build tool like Webpack, Parcel, etc., you might need to build the project first:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- Start the local server in the game's directory:
  ```bash
  http-server
  ```

### 5. **Access the Game in a Browser**:
After starting the server, it will provide you with an address, typically `http://localhost:8080`. Open that URL in a browser to start testing the game.

Happy gaming and testing! üéÆüîç
